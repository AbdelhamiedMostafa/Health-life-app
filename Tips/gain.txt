1-Get rid of anything that's fat free, Larson says. Make your own salad dressing with healthy oils, rather than buying them ready-made.
2-Bid farewell to products that have light, diet and low-cal on the label. Eat higher-calorie breads, and choose bagels over toast or English muffins.
3-Make sure that your cereal has at least 200 calories per cup
4-Also put fatty fish, like salmon, on your dinner menu. It's higher in calories and has healthy omega-3 fatty acids.
5-Eat desserts that have a lot of nutrients, like frozen yogurt, oatmeal cookies, zucchini bread, and pumpkin pie.
6-Review your fridge and cabinet, and track your eating for a few days to see what else can be replaced with high-calorie options.
7-as for exercise, running, jogging, walking, swimming, elliptical, jumping rope- do it 3x a week and you can start slow at first, like a 25 minute walk the first week or two, then bump it up to 35, etc.
